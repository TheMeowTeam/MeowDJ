/**
 * View Engine Configuration
 * (sails.config.views)
 *
 * Server-sent views are a classic and effective way to get your app up
 * and running. Views are normally served from controllers.  Below, you can
 * configure your templating language/framework of choice and configure
 * Sails' layout support.

 * For more information on views and layouts, check out:
